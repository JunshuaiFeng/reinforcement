# Advanced Artificial Intelligence - Homework 4 #


## Problem 1:

Implement an explicit policy for the mountain car environment without using any learning algorithm. Explain in detail your reasoning behind your policy and run several test episodes to measure its performance.


## Problem 2:

Implement an explicit policy for the cartpole environment without using any learning algorithm. Explain in detail your reasoning behind your policy and run several test episodes to measure its performance.

## Problem 3:

Apply the cross-entropy method to mountain car. Explain how many episodes are needed to learn a good policy. Explain which reward you use (original, modified).

## Problem 4:

List all algorithms and methods that we have covered in this course. Write 3 sentences to describe what each algorithm and method solves etc.
